**⚠️ WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! MAXIMUM CHAOS MODE! ⚠️**

An experimental quantum-inspired cryptocurrency trading simulator that brings **CRAZY QUANTUM POWER CRYPTO KAOS** to your terminal!

## 🚨 DISCLAIMER 🚨

**THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!** This is an experimental, educational, and entertainment project. 
- All trades are **SIMULATED** (no real money)
- Extremely high volatility and chaos by design
- Use at your own risk - we warned you! 💀

## 🌟 Features

- **Quantum Superposition**: Multiple trading strategies evaluated simultaneously
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Correlated analysis across crypto pairs
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Probabilistic decision-making
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Breakthrough resistance levels unexpectedly
- **Maximum Chaos Mode**: Adjustable volatility from 0% to 100%
- **Multi-Crypto Support**: BTC, ETH, DOGE, SHIB, ADA, SOL, MATIC, AVAX, NDC
- **🪙 NayDoeCoin (NDC)**: Our native cryptocurrency floated at $1.00
- **🔐 SHA-2048bit Security**: Advanced cryptographic hashing for audit trail
- **📋 Register Audit**: Immutable transaction logging with blockchain-style verification

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run the quantum chaos!
python3 quantum_trader.py
```

Follow the prompts to set your chaos level (0.0-1.0) and number of trading cycles.

**Recommended**: Start with chaos level 0.5 to ease into the madness! 🎢

## 💡 How It Works

The Quantum Crypto Trader uses quantum-inspired algorithms:

1. **Superposition Strategy Analysis**: Evaluates multiple strategies at once (Momentum, Mean Reversion, YOLO mode, Quantum Intuition)
2. **Entangled Correlation Analysis**: Detects mysterious correlations between crypto pairs
3. **Wave Function Collapse**: Randomly collapses strategies into trading actions (BUY_THE_DIP, MOON_SHOT, PANIC_SELL, HODL, QUANTUM_LEAP)
4. **Quantum Price Oracle**: Simulates crypto prices with quantum uncertainty and occasional "quantum tunneling" events

## 📊 Example Output

```
🌀 QUANTUM TRADING CYCLE | State: ENTANGLED 🌀

💰 BTC: $52341.23456789
   📊 Strategies in superposition: 4
   ⚡ Collapsed action: MOON_SHOT
🚀 QUANTUM BUY: 0.019234 BTC @ $52341.23

💰 ETH: $2847.91283746
   📊 Strategies in superposition: 4
   ⚡ Collapsed action: PANIC_SELL
📉 QUANTUM SELL: 0.582341 ETH @ $2847.91
```

## 🎮 Trading Actions

- **HODL**: Hold your position (diamond hands! 💎)
- **BUY_THE_DIP**: Buy when the price drops
- **MOON_SHOT**: Aggressive buy for maximum gains 🌙
- **PANIC_SELL**: Sell in fear (paper hands! 📄)
- **QUANTUM_LEAP**: Surprise trade based on quantum randomness

## 📁 Output

The trader saves a complete history of all trades to a JSON file:
- `quantum_trades_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

## ⚡ Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies (pure Python standard library!)

## 🎲 Chaos Levels

- **0.0-0.3**: Mild chaos (boring! 😴)
- **0.4-0.6**: Moderate chaos (exciting! 🎢)
- **0.7-0.9**: HIGH CHAOS (wild ride! 🎪)
- **0.9-1.0**: MAXIMUM CHAOS (absolute mayhem! 🌪️💀)

## 🛡️ Safety Features

Despite the chaos, this simulator includes:
- Position sizing limits (5-20% per trade)
- Virtual portfolio tracking
- Complete trade history logging
- No connection to real exchanges
- No real money at risk!

## 🪙 NayDoeCoin (NDC)

NayDoeCoin is our native cryptocurrency, floated at $1.00 with full quantum trading support:

- **Symbol**: NDC
- **Initial Price**: $1.00
- **Security**: SHA-2048bit cryptographic hashing
- **Trading**: Full buy/sell support with quantum strategies

## 📋 Register Audit System

All transactions are logged to an immutable audit register with SHA-2048bit security:

- **Blockchain-style chaining**: Each entry links to the previous via cryptographic hash
- **Tamper detection**: Chain integrity verification ensures no modifications
- **Complete audit trail**: Every transaction and event is recorded
- **SHA-2048bit hashing**: 4x SHA-512 chained for 2048-bit security

### Audit Output

The trader saves audit logs to JSON files:
- `ndc_audit_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

Each entry contains:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
  "type": "BUY",
  "symbol": "NDC",
  "amount": 100.0,
  "price": 1.00,
  "previous_hash": "...",
  "hash": "..."
}
```
